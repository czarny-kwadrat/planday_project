# planday\_project

This project contains SQL models that mimic a dbt setup for data transformation and analysis.



The activity\_data file is included as a seed file, which is a copy of the main dataset used for testing and development.



Note that this project does not have a full dbt setup structure (e.g., no full dbt folder hierarchy, macros, or extensive configurations).



As such, this is not a production-ready solution but rather a simplified prototype to demonstrate the modeling logic and workflow.
